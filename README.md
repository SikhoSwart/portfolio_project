A portfolio website is a unique way to showcase your work and let others know about yourself. A portfolio website is useful for job-seekers and employers. It's basically a glorified resume. It's the perfect way to let employers know more about your skills and experience while they also get to know about who you are. 

I created this website using HTML and CSS. [Personal Portfolio Website](https://sikholise.netlify.app)

I deployed it using [netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/)

This website does not require installation, it is only accessable online.

## Usage
This website is for job-seekers to showcase their skills. It also allows potential employers to conatact the portfolio owner. You can send a message directly to the owner.
