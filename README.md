A portfolio website is a unique way to showcase your work and let others know about yourself. A portfolio website is useful for job-seekers and employers. It's basically a glorified resume. It's the perfect way to let employers know more about your skills and experience while they also get to know about who you are. 
I created this website using HTML and CSS. 

I deployed it using [https://www.netlify.com/]
